# TODO: Update Volunteer Dashboard Edit/Delete Buttons to Icons

## Tasks to Complete:
- [x] Update `VolunteerDashboard.js` to remove text from edit and delete buttons, keeping only icons (✎ for edit, 🗑 for delete) and existing title attributes for tooltips.
- [x] Update `VolunteerDashboard.css` to style buttons as icon-only (reduce padding, make square-shaped, center icons).
- [ ] Test the dashboard to ensure icons display correctly and tooltips appear on hover.
- [ ] Verify responsiveness on different screen sizes.
